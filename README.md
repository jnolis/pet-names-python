# Pet Names Python

This is a recreation of the [pet names generator neural network](https://github.com/jnolis/pet-names) but in Python instead of R.

* `train_model.ipynb` - trains a neural network on Seattle pet data, and saves it to `model.h5`.
* `runtime.ipynb` - Use this notebook to generate the names. It loads the model and contains functions that do the generation.
